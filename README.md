# Smart-Parking-System-Using-Arduino
#Motivation
People cannot find parking in popular places. Especially during holidays, traffic is always bad. People cannot locate their car in large parking slots. Person doesnâ€™t know whether Parking is Available or not until he travels in the entire
parking. Current scenario It gets chaotic in the parking, when even after being full, more cars keep on entering the parking. With increase in the population, number of vehicles increasesand due to unmanaged parking it leads to many problems. Some of the problems include Fights and Accidents in
Parking due to parking at wrong places. Blocking of Trafficin Open Parking like Local Markets due to unsystematic parking of cars.
       
       
  This project is to set up a smart parking system.  According to primary investigation, 
nowadays maximum people want a smart parking system for hassle free parking with digital 
assistant. The IR Detection Sensor is utilized with Arduino to indicate the empty slot. By 
measuring the distance drivers can find the empty slot in parking to park the car and help the 
driver to find the slot easily and reduce the searching time. As the parking place is found to be 
empty it is detected. We achieved this by programming the sensors and Arduino. This sensor 
and Arduino Microcontroller based technological solution can prevent inadequate parking, take 
payment digitally and save time and manpower. This can be a sustainable solution at a cheaper 
cost.  The discussed systems will be able to reduce the problems which are arising due to the 
unavailability of a reliable, efficient and modern parking system, while the economic analysis 
technique will help in analyzing the projects' feasibility. 
The smart car parking project aims to provide confusion free and easy parking. This 
project helps the drivers of cars to park their vehicles with minimum waste of time with accurate 
information of the availability of the space to park. It includes an Arduino Uno as the 
microcontroller unit to which the servo motors, LCD display is interfaced. The LCD displays 
the availability of the space, the IR sensors keep the check of the number of cars entering and 
exiting the parking space. The IR sensors detect the availability of the parking space.
